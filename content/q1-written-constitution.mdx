## A Reference Point for Politics

The written constitution mainly serves as a reference point for modern-day politics. Providing clear definitions of the structure of the government, distribution of power and the fundamental rights of citizens. 

<ConstitutionStructure />

The constitution also limits the government by explicitly explaining the things the government *does not* have the power to do, and protects minority groups.

<CaseStudy title="Unwritten Constitution" category="Comparison">
  A real world example of this is the UK. The UK doesn't actually have a written Constitution. Instead, their system is built on hundreds of years of traditions and random acts of Parliament. 
  
  This is flexible and allows for easy changes, but it can sometimes be sketchy. Because there’s no single "supreme" rulebook, their government can technically change your rights with a <Term label="simple majority" definition="More than 50% of the vote. In a 100-member Senate, 51 votes." /> 
  vote. In the US, our written Constitution is permanent. Even if 51% of Congress suddenly decides they hate free speech, they can't just vote it away. It puts protections on our rights that regular politicians can't break.
</CaseStudy>

## Rigidity and Amendments

The constitution also makes it more difficult to take away power or change rules of states, requiring amendments and not simply creating new laws, which is clearly highlighted in 
<Term label="Article V" definition="The section of the Constitution describing how to amend it. It establishes the high thresholds (2/3 of Congress, 3/4 of States)." />.

We can clearly see how it is also relatively difficult to create those amendments; Congress has passed thousands of new laws, but only 27 amendments have been added in the last 200 years.

<AmendmentDifficulty />

<CaseStudy title="The Equal Rights Amendment" category="Real World Example">
  The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is a good example of the difficulty of passing and amendment. In this case, this amendment was trying to guarantee equal rights regardless of sex.
  
  This amendment was never <Term label="ratified" definition="Formally approved by the states. For the Constitution, this requires 3/4 (38) of state legislatures to agree." />. 
  In order to change the Constitution, you need at least 38 states to agree with it, but the ERA only ever got to 35. This shows how the Constitution ensures you can't just change the constitution without almost all of the country agreeing, even if the numbers are close.
  This clearly examplifies the rigidy of the Constitution, and that it is pruposefully made to be difficult to change.
</CaseStudy>

## The Mission Statement (Preamble)

The <Term label="preamble" definition="The introductory statement of the Constitution's fundamental purposes and guiding principles." />, or mission statement, tells us *why* the constitution was written. The mission statement also helps guide politicians and courts when upholding laws, and helps us notice laws that might intrude on those values. 

It also creates a unifying goal, and not separate, dividing goals, which has mostly helped us to share similar goals and values for our country.
