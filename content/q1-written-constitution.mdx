## A Reference Point for Politics

The written constitution mainly serves as a reference point for modern-day politics. Providing clear definitions of the structure of the government, distribution of power and the fundamental rights of citizens. 

<ConstitutionStructure />

The constitution also limits the government by explicitly explaining the things the government *does not* have the power to do, and protects minority groups. This concept of "Negative Liberty" (freedom *from* interference) is distinct from "Positive Liberty" (freedom *to* act).

<CaseStudy title="The Unwritten Constitution" category="Global Comparison">
  In contrast to the US, the **United Kingdom** has an "unwritten" constitution. It is formed by Acts of Parliament, court judgments, and conventions. 
  
  *   **Pros:** It is flexible and can adapt quickly to new needs.
  *   **Cons:** Fundamental rights can be changed by a simple majority vote in Parliament. In the US, your speech rights cannot be removed simply because 51% of Congress dislikes what you say.

## Rigidity and Amendments

The constitution also makes it more difficult to take away power or change rules of states, requiring amendments and not simply creating new laws, which is clearly highlighted in Article V. 

We can clearly see how it is also relatively difficult to create those amendments; Congress has passed thousands of new laws, but only 27 amendments have been added in the last 200 years.

<CaseStudy title="The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)" category="Real World Evidence">
  The difficulty of the amendment process is not theoretical. The **Equal Rights Amendment**, designed to guarantee equal legal rights for all American citizens regardless of sex, passed Congress in 1972. However, it failed to be ratified by the required 38 states (3/4) before the deadline. 
  
  This demonstrates that even popular ideas must clear an exceptionally high bar to become fundamental law, preventing temporary passions from altering the core framework.

## The Mission Statement (Preamble)

The preamble, or mission statement, tells us *why* the constitution was written. The mission statement also helps guide politicians and courts when upholding laws, and helps us notice laws that might intrude on those values. 

<QuoteBlock source="U.S. Supreme Court, Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905)">
  "Although the Preamble indicates the general purposes for which the people ordained and established the Constitution, it has never been regarded as the source of any substantive power conferred on the Government..."

It also creates a unifying goal, and not separate, dividing goals, which has mostly helped us to share similar goals and values for our country.
