Are the beliefs by the founders being lived up to today? The main beliefs of the Founding Fathers were <Term label="republicanism" definition="A political ideology centered on citizenship in a state organized as a republic." />, <Term label="separation of powers" definition="The division of government responsibilities into distinct branches to limit any one branch from exercising the core functions of another." />, <Term label="checks and balances" definition="A system that allows each branch of government to amend or veto acts of another branch so as to prevent any one branch from exerting too much power." />, and the fear of tyranny.

While some of their expectations may have been exceeded in the modern day, there are clear events happening today that the Founding Fathers feared would happen.

## The Faction Problem

Madison argued in <Term label="Federalist No. 10" definition="An essay by James Madison arguing that a strong, large republic would better protect against the dangers of factions than smaller republics." /> that having a large republic would prevent any single <Term label="faction" definition="A small organized dissenting group within a larger one, especially in politics." /> (political party) from dominating because there would be too many competing interests.

However, George Washington warned that if someone’s loyalty was to the party over the nation, then it could lead to <Term label="despotism" definition="The exercise of absolute power, especially in a cruel and oppressive way." />.

  "The alternate domination of one faction over another... is itself a frightful <Term label="despotism" definition="The exercise of absolute power, especially in a cruel and oppressive way." />."
</QuoteBlock>

Shifting to today, it is distinct that there are **two massive factions** whose ideas sometimes conflict with the core values of the nation. The <Term label="polarization" definition="Division into two sharply contrasting groups or sets of opinions or beliefs." /> we see today is exactly the "spirit of party" that Washington warned us about.

## Ceding Power

Most of the separations of powers were created so that each branch would jealously guard their power from each other, that way no one gained too much power. 
Unfortunately, Congress today has mostly <Term label="ceded" definition="Given up (power or territory)." /> a lot of power to federal agencies or the White House, ruining balance and allowing the Executive Branch to have much more power than what the founders intended. 
## Individual Rights

On the contrary, some things have been exceeded—mainly **individual rights**. The Founding Fathers failed to recognize slavery, the exclusion of women, racism, and different sexualities.
This is mainly due to the interpretation of “all men are created equal” in the Declaration of Independence, and the freedom to have access to things like healthcare and education. 

<CaseStudy title="Expanding 'We The People'" category="Civil Rights">
  The definition of "All men are created equal" has grown significantly:
  
  *   **1865-1870:** 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments ended slavery and granted citizenship.
  *   **1920:** The 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote.
  *   **1964:** The Civil Rights Act outlawed discrimination.
  *   **2015:** *Obergefell v. Hodges* legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.

In short, some of the beliefs are not being lived up to today, while others have exceeded expectations originally envisioned by the founders.
