## A Mixed Report Card

Are we living up to the Founders' vision? The answer is complicated. The machinery of government—the electrons and protons of the system—largely functions as designed. Presidents leave office peacefully (mostly), courts issue rulings that are obeyed, and elections happen on schedule.

## Where We Fail

However, the spirit of the system is often tested.
*   **Congressional Abdication:** The Founders expected Congress to be the most powerful branch. Today, Congress often delegates its power to the Executive agencies, creating the "Administrative State" that Brutus feared.
*   **Erosion of Federalism:** State lines mean less today than they did in 1787. Federal money (grants-in-aid) is often used to coerce states into following national standards.

## Where We Succeed

Yet, the core belief in **Liberty** remains strong. The Bill of Rights is more robustly enforced today than at any time in history. Freedom of speech, religion, and the press are vibrant.

  "The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the Republican model of Government, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked, on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people."

We are still running the experiment. Whether we are living up to it is a question that must be answered by every generation.
