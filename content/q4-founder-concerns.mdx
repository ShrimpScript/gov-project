## The Fear of Factions

The primary concern of Founders like James Madison was the danger of "factions"—groups of citizens acting against the rights of others or the permanent interests of the community. In **Federalist No. 10**, Madison argued that a pure democracy would inevitably allow a majority faction to tyrannize the minority.

  "Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction..."

## The Anti-Federalist Warning

On the other side, Anti-Federalists like "Brutus" feared that the new Constitution created a central government that was too powerful and distant. In **Brutus No. 1**, he warned that the "Necessary and Proper" clause and the "Supremacy Clause" would eventually swallow up the states.

## Were They Right?

Looking at modern American politics, both sides seem prophetic.
*   **Madison was right:** Partisanship (factions) often grinds governance to a halt.
*   **Brutus was right:** The federal government has grown exponentially in size and scope, often at the expense of state sovereignty.

The Founders' concerns were valid, and the tension they identified defines our politics today.
