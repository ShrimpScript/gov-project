## Centralized Power

The main concerns in the constitution were that there would be a centralized power in the government, which contradicted their independence from Great Britain.

## The Missing Bill of Rights

The constitution also had no Bill of Rights which was a major concern because the Anti-Federalists believed that if the rights of the people were never clearly listed in writing, the government would eventually go against them.

## Presidential Power

Another major concern was that the President held too much power in the military and foreign policy that they would essentially be another king.

## Validity of Concerns

These concerns are valid because the Americans had fled Great Britain because of their tyrannical king, and didn’t want their own government to represent that. Things like having protections from the government, freedom of speech, and other liberties were essential to keeping the government more limited, and giving the people the power.

## The Great Debate

This was also a very big, national argument between two groups of people: Anti-Federalists (believed in the government being limited) and the Federalists (believed in a stronger federal government). These concerns were mainly reflected by the Anti-Federalists, which eventually led to the creation of the Bill of Rights that we have today.
