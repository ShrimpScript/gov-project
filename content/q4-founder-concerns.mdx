*The Constitutional Convention was far from a peaceful agreement—it was a heated battle over the future of power.*

## Centralized Power

The main concerns in the constitution were that there would be a centralized power in the government, which contradicted their independence from Great Britain.

The Anti-Federalists were terrified that a strong federal government would just become a "new monarchy" in disguise. They argued that the "Necessary and Proper" clause would let Congress pass literally any law they wanted, swallowing up the states.

## Missing Bill of Rights

The constitution originally had *no* Bill of Rights. The Anti-Federalists believed that if the rights of the people were never clearly listed in writing, the government would inevitably trample them.

<CaseStudy title="Were they right? The Alien & Sedition Acts" category="Real World Evidence">
  Just **7 years** after the Bill of Rights was added (1791), the government proved the Anti-Federalists completely right.
  
  In 1798, Congress passed the **Alien and Sedition Acts**, which made it illegal to "write, print, utter, or publish... false, scandalous and malicious writing" against the government. People were literally thrown in jail for criticizing the President. 
  
  If the Anti-Federalists hadn't fought for the **First Amendment** (Freedom of Speech) to be vital written law, we might not have the right to criticize our leaders today.

## Presidential Power

Another major concern was that the President held too much power in the military and foreign policy that they would essentially be another king.

<CaseStudy title="Modern Kings? Executive Orders" category="Modern Connection">
  The Founders feared a President who could make laws on their own, like a King issuing a decree. Today, we have **Executive Orders**—directives from the President that have the force of law without going through Congress.
  
  While these are meant to just "execute" existing laws, Presidents from both parties use them to make major policy changes (like immigration reform or student loan forgiveness) when Congress is stuck. This is exactly the kind of "unilateral power" the Anti-Federalists warned us about.

These concerns are valid because the Americans had fled Great Britain because of their tyrannical king, and didn’t want their own government to represent that. Things like having protections from the government, freedom of speech, and other liberties were essential to keeping the government more limited, and giving the people the power.

## Side Note

This was also a very big, national argument between two groups of people: Anti-Federalists (believed in the government being limited) and the Federalists (believed in a stronger federal government). These concerns were mainly reflected by the Anti-Federalists, which eventually led to the creation of the Bill of Rights that we have today.
