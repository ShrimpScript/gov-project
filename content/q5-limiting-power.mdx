## Structural Limits Needed

The Constitution both grants and restricts power, which is essential for a stable government and not an all powerful one. 
The Founders didn't trust future people to not abuse their power, so they created a system where power is separated and distributed, 
making it very difficult for one person to take over.

## Separation of Powers

Power isn't concentrated in one building. Instead, it's split into three distinct branches, each with its own job. This prevents any single group from having total control.

*   **Article I (Legislative):** Congress makes the law.
*   **Article II (Executive):** The President enforces the law.
*   **Article III (Judicial):** The Supreme Court interprets the law.

## Checks and Balances

It's not enough to just separate power; you have to make sure the branches can fight back against each other. Each branch has a "weapon" to check the others.

Example: If the President tries to pass a bad law, Congress can refuse to fund it. If Congress passes a bad law, the President can <Term label="veto" definition="The constitutional right of the President to reject a decision or proposal made by a law-making body." /> it. If they both agree on a law that violates the Constitution, the Supreme Court can use <Term label="judicial review" definition="The power of courts to decide whether acts of Congress or the Executive are constitutional. Established in Marbury v. Madison." /> to strike it down.

<CaseStudy title="No One Is Above The Law" category="Real World Evidence">
  A perfect example of this is **United States v. Nixon (1974)**. President Nixon tried to hide audio tapes related to the Watergate scandal, claiming he had "Executive Privilege" (basically saying the President has special secrets).
  
  The Supreme Court said "No." They ruled unanimously that **not even the President is above the law**. Checks and balances worked—the Court checked the President, and Nixon resigned shortly after.

## Federalism

Power is also divided vertically. The <Term label="tenth amendment" definition="The amendment that states that any power not specifically given to the federal government belongs to the states or the people." /> explicitly states that powers not delegated to the US are reserved to the States or the people. This means the Federal Government can't just do whatever it wants—it only has the powers the Constitution *specifically* gives it.

## The Bill of Rights

The first ten amendments are a list of "Thou Shalt Nots" directed at the government. It cannot prohibit speech, establish religion, or conduct unreasonable searches. These are hard limits that protect individual liberty from the majority.
