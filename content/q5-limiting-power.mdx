## Constitution Limits Power

The Constitution both grants and restricts power, which is essential for a stable government and not an all powerful one. 
The Founders didn't trust future people to not abuse their power, so they created a system where power is separated and distributed, 
making it very difficult for one person to take over.


## Separation of Powers

The powers in the federal government are separated into three distinct branches which all have different jobs. This prevents any single group from having total control or total power,
mainly to decentralize power.

*   **Article I (Legislative):** Congress makes the law.
*   **Article II (Executive):** The President enforces the law.
*   **Article III (Judicial):** The Supreme Court interprets the law.

## Checks and Balances

Seperating powers is still not enough though, you have to make sure the branches can fight back against each other in case one tries to take over. Each branch has a way to check the others, examples being:
impeachment, veto, judicial review, etc.

<SeparationOfPowers />

Say the President tries to pass a bad law, Congress can refuse to fund it. If Congress passes a bad law, the President can <Term label="veto" definition="The constitutional right of the President to reject a decision or proposal made by a law-making body." /> it. 
If they both agree on a law that violates the Constitution, the Supreme Court can use <Term label="judicial review" definition="The power of courts to decide whether acts of Congress or the Executive are constitutional. Established in Marbury v. Madison." /> to revoke it.

<CaseStudy title="United States v. Nixon (1974)" category="Real World Evidence">
  A perfect example of this is **United States v. Nixon (1974)**. President Nixon tried to hide audio tapes which were related to the Watergate scandal, claiming he had "Executive Privilege" (basically claiming that the President has special privileges).
  
  The Supreme Court denied him, ruling unanimously that not even the President is above the law. The Court checked the President, and Nixon resigned shortly after.

The <Term label="tenth amendment" definition="The amendment that states that any power not specifically given to the federal government belongs to the states or the people." /> explicitly states that the Federal Government can't just do whatever it wants—it only has the powers the Constitution *specifically* gives it,
therefore limiting the power of the federal government.

## The Bill of Rights

The first ten amendments is a list of rights that are directed at the government of what it cannnot strictly do. It cannot prohibit speech, establish religion, or conduct unreasonable searches. These are hard limits that protect individual liberty from the majority, again, limiting the power of the federal government.

## Summary

In summary, the Consitution limits powers of the federal government by establishing a system of checks and balances, seperation of powers, and a Bill of Rights that strictly forbids the federal government from doing certain things, and therefore limits powers of the federal government.
