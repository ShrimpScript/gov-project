## Structural Limits needed

The Constitution does not just grant power; it aggressively restricts it. The Founders did not trust human nature with unchecked authority.

<StatCard label="Articles" value="7" />

## 1. Separation of Powers
Power is not concentrated in one building.
*   **Article I:** Congress makes the law.
*   **Article II:** The President enforces the law.
*   **Article III:** The Supreme Court interprets the law.

## 2. Checks and Balances
Each branch has a weapon to use against the others.
*   **Veto:** The President can stop a law.
*   **Override:** Congress can bypass a veto (2/3 vote).
*   **Judicial Review:** The Courts can strike down laws (established in *Marbury v. Madison*).

## 3. Federalism
Power is divided vertically. The Tenth Amendment explicitly states that powers not delegated to the US are reserved to the States or the people.

## 4. The Bill of Rights
The first ten amendments are a list of "Thou Shalt Nots" directed at the government. It cannot prohibit speech, establish religion, or conduct unreasonable searches.
